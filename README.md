**Instructions**
- Please find my widget submission hosted on GitHub pages here: https://james-arn.github.io/widget/
- Please clone and run "npm start" to see it locally. 
- Please find notes and screenshots below. 

**Notes**
- All details finished apart from the colour on load and changing to different themes. This was achieved when making one widget, but needed senior guidance on implementing to all 3 widgets on one page.
- Although the brief said should take only a few hours, I did spent a considerable amount of time more over the weekend. 
- However I really enjoyed the task and would be keen to learn more to make the code more in line with DRY principles and learning off a senior dev.
